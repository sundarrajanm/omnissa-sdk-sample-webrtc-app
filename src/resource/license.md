Disclaimer
This Electron sample application(including both client and server) is not an official Omnissa product.
The sample application itself does not contain any open source or third-party source code or library.
To build and run the application, you might need some NodeJS packages(with their own licenses) which are specified in those 'package.json' files. But you could have you own implementation as well.
